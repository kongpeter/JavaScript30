# 04 - Array Cardio Day 1

## Achievement

This part is mainly to help you familiar with several basic methods of `Array`. There are two iterative methods (filter and map) defined by Es5. These iterative methods have only one feature: run a given function for each item of the array, but have different results according to the different iteration methods used.

The document provides an `inventor` array for initial operation. Based on this array, you can practice various methods of array. Please open HTML and view the output results in the console.




## Console

We often use `console.log()` as output in console. However, there is an amazing way to output a table:

```css
console.table(table name)
```
