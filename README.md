## What is JavaScript30
Javascirpt30 is a 30 day challenge created by Wes BOS. The project provides 30 video tutorials, 30 challenge documents and 30 challenge solution source codes available for free. The goal is to help people write in vanilla JavaScript, without frameworks and libraries, without compilers and references.
The slogan of this project is:
> Build 30 things in 30 days with 30  tutorial
> No Frameworks × No Compilers × No Libraries × No Boilerplate




## About JavaScript30
New tools can help us improve our productivity, but the original JavaScript must be the missing part of many people's knowledge structure. If you want to explore it, please follow this guide to explore the original world of JavaScript.

Another reason for writing this guide is that after reading the guides written by [soyaine](https://github.com/soyaine), I decided to follow his examples and sort out my ideas while taking notes. I believe that learning by use could be the best way to learn. I hope this guide can help people who want to practice, especially those who want to get started in JavaScript.



## About Me
I am currently an information technology engineering student from the University of Melbourne. I'm a front-end developer. Therefore, I wrote this tutorial for another purpose: to record my learning process of the front end. This process is extremely boring and requires a lot of work. Perhaps many years from now, I will be very grateful for this period of boredom.
